# Purpose,

This project automates the update process of a Docker-based project when the source code changes on github.

The scenario is:

- Github is used as a repository for your code
- You pulled the code to a machine and brought the service up using docker-compose up
- You want to automatically rebuild the service if the source code is updated in github

Installation:

- Create a directory to load this project
